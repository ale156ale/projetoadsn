1) Connect to PostgreSQL database

  psql -d database -U  user -W

2) Switch connection to a new database

   \c dbname username

3) List available databases

   To list all databases in the current PostgreSQL database server, you use \l command:
   \l

4) List available tables

   To list all tables in the current database, you use \dt command:
   \dt

   Note that this command shows the only table in the currently connected database.

5) Describe a table

   To describe a table such as a column, type, modifiers of columns, etc., you use the following command:
   \d table_name

6) List available schema

   To list all schemas of the currently connected database, you use the \dn command.
   \dn

7) List available functions

   To list available functions in the current database, you use the \df command.
   \df

8) List available views

   To list available views in the current database, you use the \dv command.
   \dv

9) List users and their roles

   To list all users and their assign roles, you use \du command:
   \du

10) Execute the previous command

   To retrieve the current version of PostgreSQL server, you use the version() function as follows:
   SELECT version();

   Now, you want to save time typing the previous command again, you can use \g command to execute the previous
   command:
   \g

   psql executes the previous command again, which is the SELECT statement,.

11) Command history

   To display command history, you use the \s command.
   \s

   If you want to save the command history to a file, you need to specify the file name followed the \s command as
   follows:
   \s filename

12) Execute psql commands from a file

   In case you want to execute psql commands from a file, you use \i command as follows:
   \i filename

13) Get help on psql commands

   To know all available psql commands, you use the \? command.
   \?

   To get help on specific PostgreSQL statement, you use the \h command.

   For example, if you want to know detailed information on ALTER TABLE statement, you use the following command:
   \h ALTER TABLE

14) Turn on query execution time

   To turn on query execution time, you use the \timing command.
   dvdrental=# \timing
   Timing is on.
   dvdrental=# select count(*) from film;
   count
   -------
     1000
   (1 row)

   Time: 1.495 ms
   dvdrental=#

   You use the same command \timing to turn it off.
   dvdrental=# \timing
   Timing is off.
   dvdrental=#

15) Edit command in your own editor

   It is very handy if you can type the command in your favorite editor. To do this in psql, you \e command. After
   issuing the command, psql will open the text editor defined by your EDITOR environment variable and place the
   most recent command that you entered in psql into the editor.

   psql commands

   After you type the command in the editor, save it, and close the editor, psql will execute the command and
   return the result.

   psql command example

   It is more useful when you edit a function in the editor.
   1
   \ef [function name]

   psql commadn ef edit function

16) Switch output options

   psql supports some types of output format and allows you to customize how the output is formatted on the fly.
     *  \a command switches from aligned to non-aligned column output.
     *  \H command formats the output to HTML format.

17) Quit psql

   To quit psql, you use \q command and press enter to exit psql.
   1
   \q

   In this tutorial, we have shown you how to use psql commands to perform various commonly used tasks.
